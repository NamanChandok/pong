<p>Recreation of <b>Pong</b> by <b>Atari</b> using lua language.</p>

<p>Pong is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games and created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey">Magnavox Odyssey</a>, the first home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement. Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game.</p>
